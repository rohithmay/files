## Synopsis

This section reviews the following three papers on Central Bank Intervention in the foreign exchange market, under the Indian context. The papers are:

- Paper 01: Behera et al. 2008 on Policy effectiveness of Central Bank Intervention using time series data and the GARCH (1,1) model.
- Paper 02: BIS paper 73. 2013 on the issues pertaining to exchange rate movement, and its impact to real economy, financial stability and monetary policy.
- Paper 03: RBI occasional paper. Vol 33. 2012. On major volatility episodes in India and the appropriate responses and outcomes.

From this reading, I understood that the need for Central Bank to intervene in the foreign exchange market when there is demand-supply mismatch in domestic currency or to curb speculative pressures on exchange rate. Sudden surge in capital inflows or unanticipated slowdown in the same creates this change in capital flows. The different nature of crises in the past and the study of previous responses (Paper 03) indicates that the response strategy and extent is situation-dependent. The effectiveness of RBI’s partially sterilized intervention to correct demand-supply mismatch in forex market through select public banks is unclear (Paper 01). I gather that the reason for this is that the Bank’s prime objective is to reduce volatility than to change the direction of exchange rate movement.

According to time series data on variables such as RBI purchases and Sales, Interest rate differentials and inflation rate differential, and the GARCH model Paper 01 find that FII investments increase volatility and the Bank is in fact effective in reducing this volatility in the short term. From Paper 02, I understand that there is difficulty in measuring intervention effectiveness for 1. Other factors such as fiscal policy, interest rates etc., are imperfectly controlled in empirical models. And 2. The long-term benefits of growth through intervention is difficult to measure. Another important facet is the idea of signalling mechanism – for correct signalling between the Bank and market participants is essential to avoid self-fulfilling speculative activities. There are three channels through which sterilized intervention is carried out – Portfolio Balance, Signalling and Noise-trading channels.


*Some of my reading notes on the three papers follow.*

## Paper 01: Behera et.al., 2008

**Title:** Relationship between Exchange Rate Volatility and Central Bank Intervention: An Empirical Analysis for India. Behera, Narasimhan, Murty, 2008.

### Key ideas

- Paper studies the effects of RBI intervention on exchange rate level and volatility.
- Uses monthly data from April ’95 to Dec ’06 (long time series data) and the GARCH (1,1) model. (Bollerslev 1986)
    - India-US bilateral nominal exchange rate.
    - RBI interventions – purchases, sales, net purchases.
    - India-US – interest rate differential and inflation rate differential.
    - Net FII investment in India.
- Finds that RBI intervention reduces volatility in Indian forex market. Does not reverse the trend movement of exchange rate.
- Also finds that Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) investments increase exchange rate volatility in India.
- Liberalization of the ‘90s allowed foreign capital inflows into India, especially in the form of private capital flows i.e., Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Portfolio Investment.
- 1992 – Integration of Indian and global financial markets, facilitated by
    - FIIs entering Indian capital market, and
    - Domestic companies raising foreign capital through:
        - Global Depository Receipts
        - American Depository Receipts
- Movement towards **full capital account convertibility**. Resulted in surge in forex inflows; Rupee appreciates; Also adds uncertainties to financial markets. Increases speculation in forex market.
- RBI intervenes in order to curb excessive fluctuations and correct misalignments.
- No unanimity about efficacy of Central Bank Intervention - Different in models & data studied yields different results.

### Intervention types – sterilized and non-sterilized.

- Direct intervention is defined as the purchase of foreign currency assets by the Central Bank to influence exchange rate. There are other reasons for purchase and sale of foreign assets by the Central Bank.
- If interventions lead to increase in monetary base – non-sterilized interventions.
- If authorities simultaneously (with short time-lag) take steps to offset the effects of change in foreign asset holdings on monetary base – sterilized intervention.
- Non-sterilized intervention affects exchange rate because of changes in stock of the monetary base. The effect of sterilized intervention on exchange rate is dispute; it leaves the monetary base unchanged.

### Sterilized Intervention

Sterilized intervention works through 3 channels:

1. Portfolio Balance Approach
2. Signalling Channel
3. Noise-trading Channel

### Portfolio Balance method

- Domestic and foreign assets are assumed to be imperfect substitutes.
- Investors allocate portfolios to balance their risk against expected rate of return.
- But Central Bank intervenes – sells foreign currency assets – leads to excess supply of foreign currency and excess demand for domestic currency assets.
- To return to equilibrium, agents need to be compensated by a higher expected return on foreign currency assets. Takes the form of widening interest rate differentials and appreciation of domestic currency. – case where sterilized intervention affects exchange rate. But this has no empirical support.
- Obstfeld 1983 – found two different results.
- Rogoff 1984 – failed to find a statistically significant coefficient with the right sign for the portfolio balance variables.
- Dominguez and Frankel 1993 – favourable results of the hypothesis.
- Bhaumik and Mukhopadhyay 2000 – found the impact of intervention wasn’t unclear.

### Signalling Channel

- Assumes information asymmetry between market participants and the Central Bank. – refer Mussa 1981 paper on this.
- Intervention causes private agents to alter their exchange rate expectations.
- By buying foreign currency for domestic currency in forex, the Central Bank might signal an expansionary monetary policy. (due to increase in money supply).
- Market participants will then expect an easy monetary policy and would revise their expectations of future exchange rate. – Also reassess their expectations on future spot rates. (only if Central Bank’s forex operations are perceived to be credible)
- Study if intervention correctly signals changes in monetary policy – take on Central Bank credibility.
    - Dominguez 1992 – Intervention conveys information of future monetary policy.
    - Klien and Rosengren 1991 – Impact of intervention declines with time.
    - Kaminsky and Lewis 1996 – Regime-switching model used – inconclusive evidence to whether intervention correctly signals monetary policy changes.
    - Fatum and Hutchinson 1999 – Fed interventions increased the conditional variance of Federal funds futures rate.
- Study the effects of expectations on future spot exchange rates.
    - Dominguez 1990 – used survey data on exchange rates as a proxy for future spot rate – found statistically significant impact of Fed and Bundesbank intervention.
    - Galati et al. 2005 – Currency options price data can be used as a proxy for market participants’ assessment of future exchange rate.

### Noise-trading Channel

- Can operate even when intervention is carried out discreetly. – Doesn’t provide a signal to market participants. Nor does is it large enough to alter relative supply of domestic and foreign currency assets.
- Central Bank intervention induces noise traders to buy or to sell currency.
- Central Bank can manipulate the exchange rate by entering in a relatively thin market and on a minute-by minute basis – here the exchange rate is determined by marginal demand and supply flow in forex market.
- Goodhart and Hesse 1993 – secret intervention to calm excessive volatility – circumstantial. Hung 1997 – Intervention success depends on timing and strategy of the Central Bank.

### Conditional Volatility of Exchange rates

- World of finance is complex – impossible to study interventions through particular channels.
- Intervention is mainly for short-term stability – thus the effectiveness of interventions should look at short term movements only.
- To examine Central Bank intervention effectiveness
    - Direct study of conditional volatility of exchange rates – GARCH models
    - Implied volatility of exchange rates – currency option pricing models.
- Almekinders and Eijffinger 1994 – GARCH model – Bundesbank and Fed intervention unsuccessful in systematically reversing unwanted movements in mark-dollar and yen-dollar interest rates.
- Dominguez 1998 – secret intervention increases volatility, generally. (But is situation specific – effects can be positive or negative).
- Aguilar and Nydahl 2000 – bivariate GARCH, implied volatility approach – intervention has no significant effect for exchange rate level. Weak evidence for reduction in volatility.
- Doroodian and Caporale (2001) - ARCH(8)-M - significant impact of intervention on exchange rate levels and volatilities. But intervention led to increase in volatility.
- Pattanaik and Sahoo 2001 - calculated exchange rate volatility from the standard deviation of daily rupee–dollar rates over the month - RBI reduces exchange rate volatility – only through a small magnitude.
- Unnikrishnan and Ravimohan 2001 – ARCH – RBI intervention affects exchange rate level and volatility in expected directions – but coefficient low in mean equation.

### In short

Opinion divided on effectiveness of Central Bank intervention of stabilizing exchange rate. There are three different channels of response. Response reduces exchange rate volatility by stopping speculative attacks on the currency. But response could also increase market uncertainty and encourage speculative attack on the currency only to cause much of the problem discussed here.

### RBI’s intervention

RBI intervenes secretly through select public-sector banks – corrects demand-supply mismatch in the forex market. Public sector banks would undertake deals in inter-bank market & RBI provides cover at the end of each day. RBI intervention is secret. RBI intervention is partially sterilized. Thus, the effectiveness of RBI intervention is unclear.

### Data and Methodology employed in the paper

- Potential data sources: RBI Monthly Bulletin, Handbook of Statistics on Indian Economy, International Financial Statistics, Fed St. Louis, SEBI database.
- Variables: RBI intervention in forex market, exchange rate return, interest rate differential ($$IntD$$), inflation rate differential ($$InflD$$), net $$FII$$ investment.
- Intervention variables: purchases ($$Pur$$), sales ($$Sal$$) and net purchases ($$Invr$$) of USD. All are in hundred million of rupees units.
- Exchange rate return: $$ Return_t = 100 \times (lnS_t - lnS_{t-1})$$, where $$S$$ is the spot exchange rate. Exchange rate movements are affected by intervention (capital flows). But Jalan 2003 states that trade deficit and economic growth are also contributors.
- $$ FII$$ is the net purchases of debt and eequity by foreign institutional investors during the month in hundred million rupees.
- Interest Rate Differential $$IntD$$ is the difference between the Indian 91-day bill rate and US 3-month Treasury Bill rate.
- Inflation Rate Differential $$InflD$$ is the difference between inflation rates of India and the US, calculated from the Wholesale Price Index of India and CPI of US.
- Dummy Variables to account for the effect of the 1997-98 crisis. $$VDum$$ which is 1 for high spikes in exchange rate return and 0 otherwise. $$Dum$$ which is 1 pre-crisis time period and 0 for the post-crisis time period.
- Monthly data has about 141 observations over the years.
- RBI intervenes to correct the demand-supply mismatch (difference between the purchase and sale transactions in the merchant segment of the spot market).
- RBI intervention affects exchange rate and its volatility by changing the market fundamentals, expectations of the future fundamentals of policies and speculative bandwagons.

### GARCH (1,1) model

$$Return_t=a_0 + a_1 Return_{t-1} + a_2 Pur_t + a_3 Sal_t + a_4 FII_t + a_5 IntD_t + a_6 InflD_t + a_7 VDum_t + \epsilon_t$$

$$\epsilon|\Omega_{t-1} \sim N(0,h_t)$$

$$h_t=b_0+b_1 Invr_t+b_2 FII_t+b_3 Dum_t+b_4 VDum_t+ \alpha \epsilon_{t-1}^2+ \beta h_{t-1}$$

$$b_0,\alpha,\beta>0 \text{ and } \alpha+ \beta<1.$$

- The first equation above is the mean equation. Average return depends on its lag, $$Pur, Sal, FII, IntD, VDum$$. Random disturbance in mean equation has a conditional normal distribution.
- Now, $$ \Omega_{t-1}$$ represents the lagged information available to all participants in the forex market at time $$t$$.
- Conditional volatility $$h_t$$ depends on the net purchases, $$FII$$ and $$\epsilon_{t-1}^2$$.

*Other terms and concepts:*

### American Repository Receipt

**American Repository Receipt (ADR).** It is a financial product – a certificate issued by American Depository Banks and is traded on NYSE, Nasdaq. etc. (Hayes, 2020).

- It is a negotiable certificate issued by a US depository bank representing a specified number of shares of investment in a foreign company’s stock.
- The ADR is then traded on the US market like any other stock would trade.
- It is a feasible, liquid way for US investors to purchase stock in companies abroad, especially in emerging economies.
- Firms foreign to US are to benefit from ADRs because it makes it easier to attract American investors, without the hassle and cost of listing themselves on the US stock exchanges.
- **Popular ADR issuing banks:** Bank of New York Mellon (BNY), State Street (STT) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).

### Working of ADRs

- ADRs are denominated in USD and the underlying financial security is held by the overseas branch of a US financial institution (depository banks)
- ADR holders – the investors do not have to trade in foreign currency or have to worry about exchange rate fluctuations in the forex market – these securities clear through the US settlement systems.
- The US depository banks purchases shares on the foreign exchange market. It holds this stock as inventory and issues and ADR for domestic trading in the US- through NYSE, AMEX, Nasdaq and are also sold OTC.

### Types of ADRs

- *Sponsored ADR* – When foreign companies comply with SEC regulations and follow US accounting procedures, then banks enter into a legal agreement, where the foreign companies bear the costs of issuing the ADR and retain control over it, while the bank handles the transactions with the investors.
- *Unsponsored ADR* – The certificate issued by the bank has no direct involvement or participation or even permission from the foreign company. Different banks could issue ADRs for the same company, with different ADR offerings having different dividends.
- In sponsored ADR, there is only one kind of ADR, issued by that bank which works with the foreign company.

### Global Repository Receipt

**Global Depository Receipt:** Bank certificate issued in more than one country for shares in a foreign company. Global counterpart of the ADRs. (Chen, 2020)

- GDRs represent shares in a foreign company. Foreign branch of an international bank holds these shares and issues them to investors.
- GDRs are negotiable certificates traded in USD or Euros (EDRs). Hence investors can trade them in multiple markets – facilitate the trade of long-term debt and to generate capital.
