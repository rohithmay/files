### Key ideas

- Forex Markets facilitate cross border trade, investment and financial transactions.
- In a market determined exchange rate system – excessive exchange rates volatility, out of line with economic fundamentals – can impose real costs on the economy –through its effects on international trade and investment.
- Pressures from foreign exchange markets could complicate the conduct of monetary policy.
- Adoption market-determined exchange rate in 1993 in India – heightened volatility.
- Exchange rate policy of RBI
    - maintaining orderly conditions in the foreign exchange market
    - to prevent the emergence of destabilising and self-fulfilling speculative activities and
    - allowing the exchange rate to reflect the macroeconomic fundamentals.

### Measurement of Volatility: 1993 -2013

- Volatility of exchange rate – amount of uncertainty or risk involved with size of changes in currency’s exchange rate.
- Heightened exchange rate volatility is computed through standard deviations of daily forex market returns that are then annualized.

The periods are briefly explained:

### Post exchange rate unification period. (March 1993 to July 1995)

- Backdrop: Surge in capital inflows due to liberalization in capita account. Move towards market determined exchange rate system.
- Actions: To maintain external competiveness of exports and stability of the rupee, RBI intervened in spot market, purchased dollars and thereafter conducted open market operations to partially sterilize the expansionary impact on domestic liquidity.
- Outcome: India’s forex reserves increased from $6.4B to $20.8 billion – representing 7-month import cover – period of prolonged stability in the range Rs.31.37 and Rs.31.65 per 1 US dollar.

### Impact of Mexican Crisis (August 1995 to March 1996)

- Backdrop: Contagion of the Mexican currency crisis – sharp devaluation of Mexican peso in Dec 1994 on account of inappropriate policies, large CAD and weak macro-economic fundamentals, leading to sharp slowdown in capital inflows, and certain endogenous factors – accentuated the demand for dollar. The rupee had depreciated to Rs.36.48 per US dollar.
- Action: Rupee was overvalued in REER terms (REER – real effective exchange rate); imposition of interest surcharge on import finance, ease of CRR requirement, tightening export credit etc.
- Outcome: Stability in the range of Rs.34.28 to Rs.35.79 per US dollar.

### Impact of East-Asian Crisis (August 1997 to August 1998)

- Backdrop: Challenges to exchange rate management due to
    - the contagion effect of the South-East Asian crisis,
    - economic sanction imposed by many industrialized nations after the nuclear explosion in Pokhran (India) in May 1998
    - downgrading of the sovereign rating of India by certain international rating agencies.
- Action: RBI intervenes in spot, swap and forward markets to manage expectations and bring forward premia down – had sold billions of USD – to the tune of $3.1B. RBI’s forward liabilities increased – but came down subsequently upon normalcy
- Stability returned and expectations of the market participants about further depreciation in the exchange rate of rupee were contained and also reversed to a certain extent.

### Global Financial Crisis (2008-09 to 2011-12)

- Backdrop: Collapse of Lehman brothers and other investment banks. Fed bailing out AIG and its quantitative easing, operation twist, forward guidance etc.
- Large withdrawals of funds from the equity markets by the FIIs, reflecting the credit squeeze and global deleveraging,
- Resulted in large capital outflows during September-October 2008, with concomitant pressures in the foreign exchange market across the globe, including India.
- Action: RBI sold US dollar through agent banks. Rupee dollar swap facility for Indian banks was introduced – for comforting Indian banks in managing short term foreign funding requirements.
- RBI continues Special Market Operations (SMO) to meet forex requirements of OMCs. – liquidity neutral operations.
