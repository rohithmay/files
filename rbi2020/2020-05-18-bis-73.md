Why does exchange rate movement raise issues for EMEs?

- Its impact on the real economy in EMEs.
- Its implications for financial development and stability
- Its consequences for monetary policy

### Exchange rate and the real economy

- 1980s and ‘90s – lack of flexibility in exchange rate – exposed EMEs to risk of currency misalignment, financial instability.
- 2000s – EMEs started adopting flexible exchange rate regimes, inflation targeting – this smoothened volatility.
- Inflation targeting EMEs – exchange rates were shock absorbers.
- Reduced tolerance for currency mismatch + Exchange rate flexibility – allows countercyclical monetary policy.
- There is a threshold above which exchange rate volatility hurts the real economy.
    - In a cross-section of 52 EMEs
    - Exchange rate volatility statistically insignificant on long term growth.
    - No result in degree of development or in the income level.

    - U-shaped short-term relation between exchange rate and output volatility – up to a point higher exchange rate volatility reduces output volatility, but causes volatility beyond that point.

- Poland: Floating exchange rate helped reduce economic uncertainty in adverse shocks. But sharp exchange rate volatility lead to – use of zloty by investors as a proxy hedge currency – negative consequences for the economy.

### Exchange rate, financial development and stability

- EM crises preceded by large currency mismatches and overvalues exchange rates – important for private sector’s decision to borrow foreign currency.
- Flexible exchange rate hedging and local currency debt markets.
- Degree of market development influences choice of exchange rate.
- Increased exchange rate flexibility can help reduce currency mismatches.
- Intervention to restrict exchange rate flexibility can give a false sense of security for the private sector regarding financial risks.
- Lower exchange rate volatility leads to higher speculation about the future value of the currency. – Encourages investors to exploit the interest rate differential more aggressively (carry trade).
- Small shifts in investor portfolios can result in large capital flows and hence exchange rate volatility – need not guarantee financial market development.
- Credible peg of exchange rate regime can reduce short run exchange rate risks.
- Volatility:
    - In both directions: there is an incentive for the private sector to hedge its exchange rate risk. Example – Thailand – greater exchange rate flexibility – increased demand for hedging instruments – rise in ratio of hedged liabilities to forex liabilities.
    - One-sided exchange rate movements – reduces the private sector incentive to hedge forex risk – leads to speculative capital flows – adverse consequences for market volatility and financial development.

### Exchange rate and monetary policy

- Forex intervention should be consistent with monetary policy. Why?
    - Any inconsistency impairs transmission mechanisms for monetary policy.
    - Persistent intervention creates risks for economy – high cost of intervention, expands central bank’s balance sheet – large scale intervention to resist appreciation is financed by issuance of short-term debt by the central bank. Inflates central bank balance sheet – signals expansionary policy.
    - Need for appropriate communication – market perception of consistency required.
- Financial costs of forex intervention
    - Determined by domestic and foreign interest rate – measured using interest rate differential.
    - Reserve accumulation – high intervention – leads to lowered central bank credibility. Impair price stability function.
- Balance sheet effects of intervention
    - Average maturity of central bank securities – determines banking system liquidity – implications for transmission of sterilized intervention via banking lending channel.

### Objective of intervention

- Main motive – maintaining monetary and financial stability – curb speculative pressures on exchange rate.
- Discourage sharp volatility in capital inflows and correct dysfunctional forex market by supplying liquidity from own reserves.
- Stabilizing inflation too, for decline in exchange rate passes through into consumer prices.
- Thus, smooth the trend path rather than to influence the level of exchange rate.
- Issues regarding investor behaviour and intervention strategy:
    - Intervention can help to break the momentum effect on the exchange rate. However, it is only possible if the flows are speculative or cyclical (as opposed to fundamental or structural).
    - Intervention decision depends on type of capital inflow. If it is of the form of FDI, then exchange rate should be allowed to find its new equilibrium.
    - If inflow is through portfolio: volatility depends on whether they’re attracted by economy fundamentals or by cyclical or speculative motives. In case of latter free exchange rate movement encourages future volatility.
- Considering the externalities of intervention – questions unilateral intervention – for forex interventions divert flows from one EME to another – could result in zero-sum game.
- To insure country against external shocks, regional trade in local currencies to be strengthened.
- Most central banks intervened in spot market and preferred:
    - Transparent over secret intervention.
    - Reactive over pre-emptive intervention.

### Effectiveness of intervention

- Varied views about the effectiveness of intervention
    - Can be judged by looking at market liquidity. How far did intervention insure orderly market conditions?
    - Other view: Does intervention help relieve depreciation pressure during panic episodes?
- While some argue that interventions have long-lasting effects on exchange rate volatility others opine that intervention can influence the exchange rate only temporarily.
- Factors accounting for weakness of any effect that intervention has on exchange rate:
    - Intervention works through signalling channel. After monetary policy controls, intervention may no longer have an independent effect on exchange rate.
    - Effectiveness of portfolio balance channel may have weakened for sterilized interventions affect bank credit.
- Effectiveness of intervention is difficult to measure:
    - Difficulty in measurement could lead to incorrect assessment of its effects.
    - Other factors affecting currency performance like fiscal policy, interest rates, capital account openness and prudential measures etc. – are imperfectly controlled in empirical models.
- Intended benefits of intervention difficult to measure:
    - Intervention effective if it promotes external price competitiveness, and
    - Allows countries to insure themselves against external shocks; thereby reducing external funding costs and promoting long term growth – these benefits are difficult to measure.
- Communication is key. Intervention may be perceived differently by the market participants than what is intended by the Central Bank.

### In short

- EME Central bank interventions – small and short-lived effects on exchange rate.
- Persistent interventions – that is equilibrium shift in exchange rate – can lead to unintended effects – on exchange rate and on Central Bank’s balance sheet (therefore of commercial and public-sector banks) – adverse effects for the macroeconomy.
