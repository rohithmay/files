### Summary

- Emerging economies that are inflation-targeting often have less flexible exchange rates and have frequent foreign exchange interventions.
- When emerging economies that are more vulnerable to exchange rate fluctuations intervene in the forex market, it causes confusion about the Central Bank's commitment to the set inflation target.
- Some key findings:
  - In inflation-targeting (IT) emerging market economies (EMEs) there is an explicit but limited support for role of exchange rates. The economy structure and shocks exposed dictate this role in policy rules.
  - *Systematic, transparent* and *market-based policy implementation* reduces policy conflicts. This approach towards exchange rate also helps EMEs move towards IT.
  - The 2008 financial crisis confirms the larger role played by exchange rate policy for IT-EMEs. IT exhibit resilience to global economic shocks.



### Enhanced role of exchange rate in Inflation-Targeting EMEs

The reasons for an enhanced role of exchange rate in an inflation-targeting emerging economy are as follows.

1. There exists a **pass-through from exchange-rate to inflation** and therefore, price stability. Thus for emerging economies, *the lower credibility of policy owes its origin to this factor.*
2. EMEs often use exchange rate to mitigate the impact on output of short-term currency movements.
3. Managing exchange rate helps in **financial stability**, especially against the impact of potential depreciation on balance sheets with currency mismatches.
4. It also helps avoid the adverse consequences for external stability of a sudden stop in capital inflows.
5. Exchange rate management is necessary in undeveloped domestic financial markets that reduce exchange rate flexibility by amplifying shocks in exchange rate and therefore hindering policy implementation.
6. High degree of policy credibility frees up exchange rates, allowing it to float and hence enhances policy implementation. This is necessary for adopting a fully inflation-targeting anchor.

### Appropriate Role for the Exchange Rate in the Monetary Policy Rule

For improving macroeconomic performance of an economy certain policy rule trade-offs have to be undertaken. It is seen that inflation/output volatility is higher for emerging economies than for advanced economies. Thus advanced economies have little to gain from incorporating exchange rate explicitly in the policy function, especially in response to demand shocks, while the converse is true for emerging economies.

However it must be noted that while emerging economies might benefit from incorporating exchange rate in their policy function, too much emphasis on it also might prove detrimental. *Inclusion of exchange rate in policy function helps mitigate impact of risk-premium shocks and cost-push shocks by dampening interest rate and exchange rate volatility.*

### Role of Forex Intervention in Inflation-Targeting

In emerging economies, establishing strong policy implementation under inflation targeting can be a difficult task. Under IT, *interest rate* is the main monetary policy instrument. If forex interventions are done in a *systematic* and *transparent* manner, then it can help reduce the confusion regarding the inflation target. Transparency should be with respect to policy objectives, operational procedures and ex post evaluation; this significantly reduces the confusion regarding inflation target. A better signalling of monetary policy comes when the domestic money markets are significantly inproved. The development of domestic money market encourages using domestic monetary instruments for policy implementation rather than relying heavily on the forex intervention. Further, a strengthened domestic money market also aids in the sterilization of foreign exchange interventions.

### Role of Exchange rate during the transition to inflation-targeting

There are certain emerging economies with a flexible exchange rate regime, but not a full-fledged inflation-targeting framework. These are referred to as *emerging economies with other anchors.* In such economies the exchange rates are actively managed by forex interventions, consequently however, the monetary policy implementations tends to be more ad hoc with less basis on the market and more focus on the forex intervention. For such EMEs with other anchors is that the exchange rate channels are more stronger and also more uncertain than IT EMEs because they are financially less developed and more dollarized, thus having less overall credibility.

In order to transition to IT, such EMEs must establish a more *systematic, consistent and market based* role for exchange rates. This can be achieved by:

- Giving exchange rate a larger weight in the the interest rate reaction function or using the exchange rate as the operating policy target during the transition.
- The choice of operating policy target depends upon the degree of development of domestic money markets.
- Over time, the weights of exchange rate in the interest rate reaction function can be reduced, in gradually transitioning to inflation-targeting.
