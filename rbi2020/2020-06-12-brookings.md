## Watershed moments in Indian economy

- *Credit Planning* till mid 1980s. Credit was channelled at cheap administered rated for growth. Inflation due to structural shocks such as drought, flood, oil price changes.
- *Monetary targeting first adopted* in mid 1980s. Monetary targeting was adopted for growth in nominal GDP after accounting for tolerable inflation. RBI introduced money market instruments, and deregulated interest rates in existing money market instruments. Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) was the prime monetary policy tool, owing to poor money-market and predominance of RBI credit to the central government.
- Monetary policy became *operationally independent* in April 1997 when automatic monetisation by ad hoc treasury bill creation was done away with.
- *Multiple indicators approach* adopted by RBI in April 1998, where apart from broad money, other macroeconomic variables such as interest rates, rates of return in different markets (money, capital, govt. securities etc.), currency, credit data, fiscal position, trade, capital flows, inflation rate, exchange rate etc, are used along with output data for policy formulation.
- *Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF)* set up in 2000 enabling RBI to use repo and reverse repo rates as key policy signalling rates.
- **Multiple indicators approach** and **monetary operations through LAF** has constituted the operating framework of Indian Monetary policy until 2013.
- Following the financial crisis, the monetary and fiscal stimuli were released in the period 2009-13, leading to rising inflation and external account instability. Later, the possibility of tapering of Quantitative Easing (QE) previously adopted by the US Federal Reserve led to the taper tantrum episode in 2013.
- Since 2013, the major episodes are:
  - Adoption of inflation-targeting in 2014.
  - Significant deterioration in public sector balance sheets.
  - Demonetisation in November 2016.

## Indian monetary policy from 2000 until the financial crisis of 2008

- Since 2000, the monetary policy has been signalled through periodic modification of policy interest rates.
- RBI's work was in managing daily excess or shortage of liquidity in the money market - open market operations, outright or repos.
- Under LAF, overnight money market rates were anchored through repo and reverse repo rates.
- Monetary policy challenge in this period was managing the flood of capital inflows due to accomodative monetary policy in advanced economies (AEs)
- In 2004, under Market Stabilization Scheme (MSS), MSS bonds were issued and held by the government in a separate identifiable cash account maintained and operated by RBI.
  - These bonds are indistinguishable from existing Treasury Bills and dated securities in the hands of creditors.
  - **Mechanism of working of MSS:** The MSS bonds are serviced like any other marketable government security. The interest costs of MSS bonds are shown in the budget. The RBI in the meantime accumulates a higher amount of foreign currency assets that leas to higher earnings for RBI, which it in turn transfers the surplus to the Central Government. Therefore the interest expenses incurred by the Central government on issuance of the MSS bonds are offset by the higher transfers by RBI.

## Indian monetary policy in the aftermath of the financial crisis (2008-2013)

- Before the crisis, the cut in US Fed Funds rate led to huge jump in capital inflows into the country. Consequently, large forex purchases ensued and RBI tried to sterilize its impact on liquidity. Inflationary pressures led increase in prices.
- No direct effect of this crisis on Indian banking because of
  - limited exposure to complex derivatives and other financial instruments
  - Macro-prudential policies by RBI.
- In 2008-09, the net capital inflows fell from USD 108 billion to just USD 9 billion, making commercial borrowing and trade credit difficult.
- Foreign portfolio investors in domestic equity markets (of EMEs) also began to sell off their equity shares which reflected the deleveraging in their home markets.This led to large capital outflows in Sept-Oct 2008,  resulting in pressures in the forex market, leading to pressures in the reserves of USD held by RBI and hence a squeeze on the liquidity of the rupee.
- In order to easy this liquidity contraction, RBI's measures were:
  - Monetary policy was substantially eased with the repo rate reduced from 9 to 4.75 percent and reverse repo from 6 to 3,25 percent.
  - Adopted both conventional measures like reduction of CRR in addition to unconventional measures.
- The unconventional measures are:
  - Enhancement of broad market liquidity by cutting CRR from 9 per cent to 4.75 per cent and unwinding the MSS securities.
  - Special facilities for financial institutions like, introducing special repo window under LAF for banks on lending to mutuals funds, NBFCs and HFCs; as well as a refinance facility without collateral for banks.
  - Facilities for forex liquidity by forex market interventions.
- The result of these measures was the augmentation of potential liquidity of over Rs. 5.85 trillion.
- India's real GDP growth recovered in 2009-10 at 8.6%. This also coincided with rising inflation, initially by food inflation and further by underlying inflation. Reasons for this were increase in international commodity prices and the enhanced rural wage growth due to employment programmes.
- Inflationary pressures became evident after 2010. The pace of tightening was only gradual because the real policy rates were still negative. Inflation expectations became double digits by 2013.
- With the rising costs of inputs (wages, and raw materials), the outputs (goods and services) also rose. *This period of high inflation and inflation expectations led to India adopting an inflation-targeting regime in 2014.*

### External Management

- In the period between 2009-13, RBI practised a hands-off approach in its capital account management and forex interventions - there was no announced change in Indian Exchange rate policy.
- Following the taper tantrum episode in 2013, RBI finally changed its intervention strategy. During this, the capital outflows from India accelerated and various factors were attributed to the widening of India's current account deficit, such as:
  - Sluggish growth since 2009, that affects Indian exports
  - Elevation in international commodity prices, also supported by accomodative monetary policies in advanced economies.
  - Domestic supply and policy constraints leading to increase in imports.

## Monetary Policy on adoption of Inflation-Targeting

Monetary policy between Nov 1997 to Sep 2013 was called the **multiple indicators approach.** Under this, inflation amongst several other variables were key indicators. Instead of a formal inflation target, RBI set an outlook for inflation in its monetary policy statement.



### Why hadn't RBI adopted Inflation-Targeting earlier?

The reasons to this are as follows:

1. Unlike many other emerging economies, India has had a record of moderate inflation, with double-digits being the undesirable exception.
2. Inflation-targeting requires efficiency in monetary transmission which happens through the operation of efficient financial markets and the absence of interest rate distortions. India still requires further development in the money market, forex and corporate and govt. debt markets. Also, administered interest rates exist too.
3. Inflationary pressures often occur due to significant exogeneous supply shocks such as energy and food price sources. Therefore targeting a theoretical core inflation rate that excludes a portion of any inflation index in a low income economy is useless.
4. Until recently India did not have a pan-India consumer price index (CPI).



It was pointed out by the Committee for Financial Sector Reforms that:

> The RBI should formally have a single objective, to stay close to a low inflation number, or within a range, in the medium term, and move steadily to a single instrument, the short term interest rate (repo and reverse repo) to achieve it.



India formally adopted Inflation-Targeting, and a Monetary Policy Framework Agreement (MPFA) was signed between GoI and RBI on Feb 25, 2015. The target was set to bring down inflation below 6% by Jan 2016, 4 % for that financial year and all other years with a band of +/- 2 percent.
